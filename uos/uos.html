                            <h2>VICE CHANCELLOR MESSAGE</h2>
                            <p>It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the University of Sahiwal. The start of the new
                                academic year is always a special time on our campus, with new students and faculty, new
                                relationships and exciting conversations begin as summer break comes to a close. I
                                encourage incoming students and faculty to get involved in the campus life and
                                contribute to the many activities planned for the upcoming year. New students will take
                                advantage of the new campus facilities on ways of becoming tomorrow leaders. Our
                                challenge is to help generate ideas that will benefit society, and to educate and train
                                people to work in fields where they will be valued both for their specialized knowledge,
                                and for their ability to research, communicate and solve problems. As we look ahead and
                                seek to engage with challenges facing higher education in Pakistan today, we continue to
                                be dedicated to create an environment for our students and faculty to pursue their
                                passions and position our University for future success. The future is now, my fellow
                                students. As has been most famously quoted, “There are no secrets to success. It is the
                                result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.” At University of Sahiwal,
                                we have a goal to work in partnership with local and international educational
                                organizations and communities to make a difference at National and International level.
                                I look forward to starting this rich and rewarding journey with each and every one of
                                you. Together will we grow! Wish you all the best.</p>
